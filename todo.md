
Post to social media when a video is uploaded

this could be automatic. So that it detects when a new video is uploaded and then automatically posts to these places.
But I will start with manually implementing it.

questions:
- API?
- Selecting images through the sites

1. Scrape youtube
	- open youtube
	- find my channel
	- check if new video

2. Post thumbnail + link to twitter
	- API
	- post link plus image

3. Post to instagram with some caption
	- API?
	- post an image
